[**PSP-UFU website**](https://thales1330.github.io/PSP/)

PSP-UFU (Power Systems Platform of Federal University of Uberlândia) is a **cross-platform**, **multilingual**, **Free and Open-Source Software** (FOSS) with **advanced GUI** (Graphical User Interface) features and **CAD** (Computer-Aided Design) tools for power system studies.

The software allows for the construction of any electric **transmission network** and **control systems** through the deployment of visual elements.

For the visualization of results, the program offers linked text elements in the main screen, and also table and graph editors.

The PSP-UFU  aims to provide efficient computer simulation tools for **research and education purposes**, in addition to **industrial applications** in electrical power systems.

The software can perform the following studies:

- **Power Flow**
  - Newton-Raphson
  - Gauss-Seidel
  - Hybrid Newton-Gauss
  - Three-phase induction motors included in power flow studies
- **Short-Circuit calculation**
  - Balanced
  - Unbalanced
  - Short-Circuit power in all system buses
- **Harmonics**
  - Harmonic voltages and THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) calculation
  - Frequency scan
- **Transient and Dynamic Stability**
  - Several synchronous machine models automatically selected
  - Three-phase induction motors
  - User-defined machine controls, exciters and prime moves created using block diagrams (Exciters, AVR, PSS, Hydro and Thermal turbines, Speed Governor, etc.)
