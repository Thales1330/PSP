>Low-impedance conductor to which several electric circuits can be connected at separate points.  
Note â€“ In many cases, the bus consists of a bar. [IEC 60050](http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=151-12-30).

## Bus in PSP-UFU
The **bus** element, or simply **busbar**, is a connector or node in the PSP-UFU single-line diagram.  
This bus can represent a PCC (Point of Common Coupling), a distribution pole, a substation, a substation bus, among many other types of analysis and connection points between elements.

## Bus editing form
:::caution Attention!
The bus **must be the first electrical element inserted in the power diagram**, since all other power components are connected to it.
:::

The figure below shows the bus data insertion/editing form:

<div><center><img src={useBaseUrl("images/busForm.png")} alt="Bus form in PSP-UFU" title="Bus form in PSP-UFU" /></center></div>

This form is subdivided into four different contexts:
- **General**: where general bus information and load flow data are entered;
- **Fault**: where the *shunt* short-circuit must be inserted;
- **Stability**: containing options for displaying bus data in time-domain plots and inserting three-phase faults in transient stability calculations;
- **Power Quality**: contains the option to display the harmonic impedance seen by the bus.

#### Name
Electrical element identification. Any number of characters can be entered using the [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) standard.

All PSP-UFU power components have this field.

#### Nominal voltage
Used to calculate the base impedance of some connected elements, as well as the transformer turns ratio between buses.  
Its unit can be selected, expressed in V or kV.

Changing this parameter will modify the entire voltage of the segment connected by electrical lines, and a warning is issued to the user.

#### Controlled voltage
Characterizes the bus as a **voltage-controlled bus ([PV Bus](powerFlow))**.

:::caution Attention!
This option is only valid if a synchronous machine is connected; otherwise, the value is ignored.  
If the reactive power limit of the connected synchronous machine is exceeded, this value is also ignored.
:::

The value can be entered in p.u. or in volts (or kV if the nominal voltage is in this unit).

#### Slack bus
Characterizes the bus as a **slack bus ([Swing Bus](powerFlow))**.  
This option is only valid if a synchronous generator is connected; otherwise, an error message will appear during program calculations.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="fault">

#### Insert fault

Indicates whether there is a short-circuit at the bus in [short-circuit](fault) studies.

:::warning Warning!
Note that this option will insert a fault for the [short-circuit](fault) calculation and **will not be considered in the stability study**.
:::

#### Fault type
Selects the type of bus shunt fault:
- three-phase to ground
- phase-to-phase
- phase-to-phase-to-ground
- single-phase-to-ground

#### Fault location
Selects the phase(s) where the fault occurs (or their combination in two-phase faults); this option is disabled for three-phase faults.

#### Fault resistance and reactance
Represents the fault impedance.  
Solid short-circuits (zero-impedance faults) are represented by entering zero in both fields.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="stability">

#### Print data
Displays the edited bus data in the transient stability study plot.  
The following data are shown:
- bus voltage magnitude
- bus voltage angle

#### Insert fault
Inserts a three-phase fault at the bus in the [stability](stability) calculation.
:::warning Warning!
This option will insert a fault for the [stability](stability) calculation and **will not be considered in the [short-circuit](fault) study**.
:::

#### Time
Time instant ($t_{fault}$) when the fault occurs during [stability](stability) studies.  
This and the following fields are only accessible if a fault is inserted in the stability study.

#### Fault duration
Duration of the inserted fault ($\Delta t_{fault}$) in the stability study.  
The fault starts at $t_{fault}$ and is cleared at $t_{fault}+\Delta t_{fault}$.

#### Fault resistance and reactance
Fault impedance in stability studies.  
A solid fault is represented by inserting a very low shunt impedance ($j10^{-5}  p.u.$).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powerQuality">

#### Print bus harmonic impedance
Prints the harmonic impedance seen by this bus in the [Frequency Response](harmonics) study.

:::tip Tip
Summary of how to define bus type:
- To define the bus as a **[PQ Bus](powerFlow)**, the options "Slack bus" and "Controlled voltage" must be **unchecked**; 
- To define the bus as a **[PV Bus](powerFlow)**, **check only** the "Controlled voltage" option, leaving "Slack bus" unchecked;
- To define the bus as a **[Slack Bus](powerFlow)**, check the "Slack bus" option.  
If "Controlled voltage" is unchecked, a controlled voltage of $1{,}0~p.u.$ is assumed.
:::

:::warning Warning!
**The system must have only one slack bus**.
