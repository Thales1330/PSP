To view all calculation results from [power flow](powerFlow) and [short-circuit](fault) studies, a tabular report viewer was developed:

<div><center><img src={useBaseUrl("images/tabReport.png")} alt="Tabular data viewer in PSP-UFU" title="Tabular data viewer in PSP-UFU" /></center></div>

This viewer can be accessed from the **Tools** [Ribbon submenu](mainScreen#ribbon-menu) and then by clicking the **Data Report** button, displaying the form organized into tabs.

The units of some data in this report can be modified by selecting them in the table header, as shown in the figure above.

:::tip Tip
Values can be exported to external text and spreadsheet editors by selecting and copying (Ctrl+C) them to the clipboard.
