## About PSP-UFU

PSP-UFU (Power Systems Platform of Federal University of Uberlândia) is a **multi-platform**, **multilingual**, **free and open source (FOSS)** software with **advanced GUI (Graphical User Interface) features** and **CAD (Computer Aided Design) tools** for studies of electrical power systems.

The software allows the construction of any electrical transmission network and control systems through the deployment of visual elements. For viewing the results, the program offers **linked text elements** on the main screen and also **table and graph editors**.

The PSP-UFU aims to provide efficient simulation tools for **research** and **education** purposes, in addition to **industrial applications** in electrical power systems.

Briefly, software can perform the following studies:

- Power flow
- Short circuit calculation
- Harmonics
- Transient and dynamic stability
